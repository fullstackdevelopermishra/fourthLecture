    <h1 class="barlow-black-italic">Raj Thackeray's 'fear of minorities' dig at Sharad Pawar for remembering Shivaji Maharaj</h1>
    <img src="./img/5.avif" alt="">
    <p>.Sharad Pawar, who never even took the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, is remembering him today. He never took the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in his speeches because perhaps he might be worried that by taking his name, the votes he gets from Muslims might stop, but now he is taking the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj," Thackeray said, according to ANI.</p>
    <p>Raj Thackeray was referring to Sharad Pawar's speech at the formal launch of his party's new symbol- 'man blowing turha'- from Chhatrapati Shivaji's Raigad Fort</p>
    <p>On Thursday, the poll panel allotted tutari as election symbol to Sharad Pawar’s faction. In the past, a tutari or trumpet was sounded in a battle or on the arrival of a king. It is seen as an instrument synonymous to the era of Maratha kingdom. At present, the instrument is used in cultural, historic, religious and political events to welcome eminent personalities.</p>

    <img src="./img/6.avif" alt="">
    <p>It happened during the second session on Saturday in Ranchi when Ollie Robinson angle across a length delivery which Jaiswal needlessly poked to generate an outside edge as the ball carried towards wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, who dived forward to collect the ball.</p>
    <p>Although Foakes was not certain about the dismissal, the likes of Joe Root and Stokes were confident after taking a first glimpse at the replay as they began celebration. Jaiswal, meanwhile waited for the final decision as it was sent upstairs. Third umpire Joe Wilson played the video a few times before concluding that the ball bounced into Foakes' gloves, leaving England players shocked.</p>
    <p>The reaction of the England players left fans on social media angry as they reminded them of Rohit's "spirit of game" act earlier on Day 2. The India captain had taken a catch at slip to dismiss Joe Root, but was unsure about it as he himself asked the on-field umpire to refer it upstairs. It was Wilson again, who adjudged that the ball had bounced into his hand.</p>
